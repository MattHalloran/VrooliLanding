# Security Policy

This repo is for the landing site of Vrooli ([vrooli.com](https://vrooli.com)), not the main Vrooli platform ([app.vrooli.com](https://app.vrooli.com)). 
Therefore, security shouldn't be much of a concern here. With that in mind, we still value security highly and would appreciate that you report any 
security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report security update, you may do one of the following:   
- [create a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/MattHalloran/Vrooli/issues/new)
- [Send a message to us on Discord](https://discord.gg/6wAKfc5X)  
- [Send an email to support@vrooli.com](mailto:support@vrooli.com)  
- [DM us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/VrooliOfficial)  

We will get back to you as soon as we can. This should be within 1-2 days, but expect longer if it is the weekend.
